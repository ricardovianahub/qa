  6.1 Weather.gov API
    6.1.1 Run in Postman - check the return:
    if it was a list: (starts with a square bracket in JSON)
    [
      {
        "status": "OK"
      }
    ]
    reality:
      {
        "status": "OK"
      }
7 - Data structures
  7.1 Stack (Last in, First out) - LIFO - you add or retrieve objects and when you retrieve, the object is removed from the stack
  7.2 Queue (First in, First out) - FIFO
  7.3 Binary Tree
  7.4 Arrays
  7.5 Linked List
